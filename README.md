Overview
-----------

The Deep Face Representation Experiment is based on Convolution Neural Network to learn a robust feature for face verification task. The popular deep learning framework [<i>caffe</i>][1] is used for training on face datasets such as CASIA-WebFace, VGG-Face and MS-Celeb-1M. And the feature extraction is realized by python code [<i>caffe_ftr.py</i>][3].

Description
-------------
Data Pre-processing

 1. Download face dataset such as  CASIA-WebFace, VGG-Face and MS-Celeb-1M.
 2. All face images are converted to gray-scale images and normalized to 144x144 according to landmarks. 
 3. According to the 5 facial points, we not only rotate two eye points horizontally but also set the distance between the midpoint of eyes and the midpoint of mouth(ec_mc_y), and the y axis of midpoint of eyes(ec_y) .

   Dataset     | size    |  ec_mc_y  | ec_y  
  :----| :-----: | :----:    | :----: 
  Training set | 144x144 |     48    | 48    
  Testing set  | 128x128 |     48    | 40    

Training

 1. The model is trained by open source deep learning framework <i>caffe</i>.
 2. The network configuration is showed in "proto" file and the trained model is showed in "model" file.

Evaluation

 1. The model is evaluated on LFW which is a popular data set for face verification task.
 2. The extracted features and lfw testing pairs are located in "results" file.
 3. To evaluate the model, the [matlab code][4] or other ROC evaluation code can be used. 
 4. The model is also evaluated on MegaFace. The dataset and evaluation code can be downloaded from http://megaface.cs.washington.edu/


Results

The single convolution net testing is evaluated on unsupervised setting only computing cosine similarity for lfw pairs.
